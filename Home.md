# Introduction

Schedoscope is a scheduling framework for painfree and agile development, testing, (re)loading, and monitoring of your datahub, lake, or whatever you choose to call your Hadoop data warehouse these days.

Based on a slick Scala DSL, 

* defining a partitioned Hive table (called "view") is as simple as:

* defining its dependencies is as simple as:

* specifying its computation logic is as simple as:

* testing it is as simple as:

Running the Schedoscope shell, 

* loading the view is as simple as:

* reloading the view in case its dependencies, structure, or logic has changed is as simple as:

* monitoring what's going on is as simple as:
