###### 8/7/2015 - Release 0.1.1

We have released Version 0.1.1 as a Maven artifact to our Bintray repository (see [Setting Up A Schedoscope Project](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Setting-up-a-Schedoscope-Project) for an example pom). 

This is a minor release that comprises some code cleanup and performance optimizations with regard to view initialization and Morphline transformations. We also Ã­mplemented a [shell transformation](https://github.com/ottogroup/schedoscope/wiki/Shell-Transformations) (more documentation to come).
