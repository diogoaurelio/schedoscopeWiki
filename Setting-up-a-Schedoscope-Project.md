Schedoscope is an internal Scala DSL for specifying views / tables, their structure, dependencies, and transformation logic required compute their data from other views.

As a consequence, setting up a Schedoscope project means setting up a Scala project that uses Schedoscope as a library. For this purpose, we provide a Maven POM template. It is of course possible to use other build tools such as SBT or Ant/Ivy. You are also encouraged to look at the POM of the tutorial.
